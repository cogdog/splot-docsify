## What is a SPLOT?
This question has baffled many exports. Might it be **Smallest Possible Open Learning Technology** or maybe **Simplest Portable Online Learning Tool** ? There is even [a SPLOT that poses this question](https://cogdog.github.io/permutator/?wordsrc=splot).

Regardless, [your answers are available from the SPLOT home base](https://splot.ca/about/). Each is housed in its own Github repo, with a lengthly README. This site is aimed at organizing them in a more readable form, making use of a dynamic docsify generation suggested by [Paul Hibbitts](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/).
